Blink(1)ing your way to USB
====================

How do you work with a USB device from .NETâ€¦is it simple or do you have to dig into nasty native code. Do you know the USB spec well enough to communicate with the device?

This session will dig into how you can utilize the USB port from .NET code, it will partially look at how the framework for blink(1) was created. The code will venture from the C firmware to how it actually ended up as a .NET package on NuGet. All in all we look at the options for talking with HID based devices so you can have fun with wicked devices in your little lab at home.
