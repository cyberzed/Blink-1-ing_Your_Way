#Blink(1)ing your way to USB

###Why

* Fun
* Small utilities
* Measuring
* Examining peripherals for IoT

###But how does it all work?

* Events
	* In your dreams
	* Here we fake events
* Implementations
	* Quite herpy-derpy
	* Based on horrible APIs
	* Not getting any better

###Get running

* Connecting
	* Frameworks
		* HIDLibrary
		* MightyHID
		* HIDSharp
		* Etc.
	* Native

* Read/Write
	* Blink(1)
	* Blink(1) mk2
* Expecting events
	* WTF???
	* Big Red Button
	* Dragonrise Gamepad
* When stuff goes awkward
	* TEMPer2
* Others
	* LCD
	* Missile launcher
	* ...

###Where do we go next?

* Building a new framework
* Supporting the new .NET world
	* *nix
	* OSX
* Fingers crossed for real support
	* Sadly that won't happen
